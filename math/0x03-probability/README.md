## Tasks
0. Initialize Poisson: poisson.py
```
Create a class Poisson that represents a poisson distribution:

Class contructor def __init__(self, data=None, lambtha=1.):
data is a list of the data to be used to estimate the distribution
lambtha is the expected number of occurences in a given time frame
Sets the instance attribute lambtha
Saves lambtha as a float
If data is not given, (i.e. None):
Use the given lambtha
If lambtha is not a positive value, raise a ValueError with the message lambtha must be a positive value
If data is given:
Calculate the lambtha of data
If data is not a list, raise a TypeError with the message data must be a list
If data does not contain at least two data points, raise a ValueError with the message data must contain multiple values
```
1. Poisson PMF: poisson.py
```
Update the class Poisson:

Instance method def pmf(self, k):
Calculates the value of the PMF for a given number of successes
k is the number of successes
If k is not an integer, convert it to an integer
If k is out of range, return 0
Returns the PMF value for k
```
2. Poisson CDF: poisson.py
```
Update the class Poisson:

Instance method def cdf(self, k):
Calculates the value of the CDF for a given number of successes
k is the number of successes
If k is not an integer, convert it to an integer
If k is out of range, return 0
Returns the CDF value for k
```
3. Initialize Exponential: exponential.py
```
Create a class Exponential that represents an exponential distribution:

Class contructor def __init__(self, data=None, lambtha=1.):
data is a list of the data to be used to estimate the distribution
lambtha is the expected number of occurences in a given time frame
Sets the instance attribute lambtha
Saves lambtha as a float
If data is not given (i.e. None):
Use the given lambtha
If lambtha is not a positive value, raise a ValueError with the message lambtha must be a positive value
If data is given:
Calculate the lambtha of data
If data is not a list, raise a TypeError with the message data must be a list
If data does not contain at least two data points, raise a ValueError with the message data must contain multiple values
```
4. Exponential PDF: exponential.py
```
Update the class Exponential:

Instance method def pdf(self, x):
Calculates the value of the PDF for a given time period
x is the time period
Returns the PDF value for x
If x is out of range, return 0
```
5. Exponential CDF: exponential.py
```
Update the class Exponential:

Instance method def cdf(self, x):
Calculates the value of the CDF for a given time period
x is the time period
Returns the CDF value for x
If x is out of range, return 0
```
6. Initialize Normal: normal.py
```
Create a class Normal that represents a normal distribution:

Class contructor def __init__(self, data=None, mean=0., stddev=1.):
data is a list of the data to be used to estimate the distribution
mean is the mean of the distribution
stddev is the standard deviation of the distribution
Sets the instance attributes mean and stddev
Saves mean and stddev as floats
If data is not given (i.e. None)
Use the given mean and stddev
If stddev is not a positive value, raise a ValueError with the message stddev must be a positive value
If data is given:
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of data
If data is not a list, raise a TypeError with the message data must be a list
If data does not contain at least two data points, raise a ValueError with the message data must contain multiple values
```
7. Normalize Normal: normal.py
```
Update the class Normal:

Instance method def z_score(self, x):
Calculates the z-score of a given x-value
x is the x-value
Returns the z-score of x
Instance method def x_value(self, z):
Calculates the x-value of a given z-score
z is the z-score
Returns the x-value of z
```
8. Normal PDF: normal.py
```
Update the class Normal:

Instance method def pdf(self, x):
Calculates the value of the PDF for a given x-value
x is the x-value
Returns the PDF value for x
```
9. Normal CDF: normal.py
```
Update the class Normal:

Instance method def cdf(self, x):
Calculates the value of the CDF for a given x-value
x is the x-value
Returns the CDF value for x
```
10. Initialize Binomial: binomial.py
```
Create a class Binomial that represents a binomial distribution:

Class contructor def __init__(self, data=None, n=1, p=0.5):
data is a list of the data to be used to estimate the distribution
n is the number of Bernoulli trials
p is the probability of a success
Sets the instance attributes n and p
Saves n as an integer and p as a float
If data is not given (i.e. None)
Use the given n and p
If n is not a positive value, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive value
If p is not a valid probability, raise a ValueError with the message p must be greater than 0 and less than 1
If data is given:
Calculate n and p from data
Round n to the nearest integer
Hint: Calculate p first and then calculate n. Then recalculate p. Think about why you would want to do it this way?
If data is not a list, raise a TypeError with the message data must be a list
If data does not contain at least two data points, raise a ValueError with the message data must contain multiple values
```
11. Binomial PMF: binomial.py
```
Update the class Binomial:

Instance method def pmf(self, k):
Calculates the value of the PMF for a given number of successes
k is the number of successes

If k is out of range, return 0
Returns the CDF value for k
Hint: use the pmf method
